Let's talk about some new features in the ZombieBot 2.0 Release. In this upgraded version, we've introduced different zombie types to amp up the challenge and variability.

Don't worry; the web code is conveniently available in the git directory.

About:
<br>
<br>
This is a zombie-themed IRC bot that connects to your IRC network via SSL. The bot adds an exciting twist to your channel by introducing random zombie spawns. Before running the script, make sure to change the IRC server information provided at the bottom.

Commands:
<br>

.shoot: Engage with the undead! This command lets users shoot at a randomly spawning zombie. Remember, you have a finite amount of bullets, so use them wisely.
<br>
.reload: Out of bullets? Use this command to reload your gun. It also doubles up by repairing your weapon if it explodes, ensuring you're always ready for action.
<br>
.kills: Curious about your score? The bot maintains a tally. Use this command to see where you stand.
<br>
Zombies now spawn at random intervals, roughly every 1 to 2 hours, ensuring that users are always on their toes. Prepare to defend your virtual self and your comrades as you never know when a zombie will decide to crash the party!
<br>
Make your IRC channel an adrenaline-pumping, action-filled battleground. Bond over strategies, celebrate collective victories, and brace yourself for intense battles against relentless hordes of zombies.

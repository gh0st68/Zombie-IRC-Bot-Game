# Install the IRC library using pip3
pip3 install irc

This is a zombie-themed IRC bot that connects to your IRC network via SSL. The bot adds an exciting twist to your channel by introducing random zombie spawns. Before running the script, make sure to change the IRC server information in the code provided at the bottom.

The bot responds to specific commands initiated by users in the IRC channel:

!shoot: This command allows users to shoot at a randomly spawning zombie. Users can use their bullets to take down the zombie, but they have a limited supply of bullets.

!reload: When users run out of bullets, they must use the !reload command to replenish their ammunition. This action ensures they are prepared to take on the next zombie that appears.

!scores: The bot keeps track of users' scores, and users can use the !scores command to check their current standing.

Zombies will randomly spawn into the channel every 2 to 4 hours, creating an element of surprise and excitement for all participants. Users must be vigilant and ready to defend themselves when the undead menace appears.

With this zombie IRC bot, your channel becomes an interactive and thrilling battleground, where users can engage in action-packed gameplay and camaraderie while fending off hordes of zombies. Embrace the challenge and survive the relentless attacks of the undead in your virtual world!
